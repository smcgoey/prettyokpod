  <h1>A quick hello from It's Pretty OK</h1>
  <h3><em>December 23, 2022</em></h3>
  <br>
  <p>Hi there! If you're one of the handful of people who are still inexplicably listening to our podcast after close to seven years, then I have a few things to say to you:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Thank you. Seriously, thank you so very much.</li>
    <li>...Are you okay?</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Okay, now that we've gotten that out of the way, you're probably noticing that even though you're at the same URL you've gone to many times before, this is very different from the It's Pretty OK website that you're used to. Nothing is going wrong with your web browser, I promise.</p>
  <p>We're in the process of making some changes to the way we host the podcast and figured we might as well take this opportunity to also free ourselves from the "shackles" of paying Squarespace for website hosting, so I'm in the process of setting up a new site that can operate in the way we want it to.</p>
  <p>If you want to get updates when we're done with things like porting over whatever blog posts from the old site we're going to keep, etc., you can subscribe to a "newsletter" I just set up <a href="https://tinyletter.com/prettyokpod" target="_blank">here</a>. "Newsletter" is in quotes because there's not really a plan to make it a frequent or consistent thing -- just a few notes to let you know that we've finished renovating the site. If more frequent updates, emails with new blog posts, reviving the Linkstravaganza, and other stuff like that is something you'd <b><em>want</em></b>, feel free to drop me a line at <a href="mailto:itsprettyok@gmail.com" target="_blank">itsprettyok@gmail.com</a> and I will take it under advisement.</p>
  <p>But in the meantime, the best way to keep getting the podcast is to subscribe. The show is <a href="https://shows.acast.com/prettyokpod" target="_blank">hosted on Acast now</a> and can be found there, but you can also get it just about anywhere that one might listen to pods:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/id1092905414" target="_blank">Apple Podcasts</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkcy5hY2FzdC5jb20vcHVibGljL3Nob3dzLzYzOWRiNGM0MTc3MGUyMDAxMTVhMjY1Yg" target="_blank">Google Podcasts</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://overcast.fm/itunes1092905414" target="_blank">Overcast</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://pca.st/itunes/1092905414" target="_blank">Pocket Casts</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/6O9EzudpUHTJ87Bb2aC5F0" target="_blank">Spotify</a></li>
  </ul>
  <p>And if you listen to your podcasts somewhere else, you can copy and paste the link to <a href="https://feeds.acast.com/public/shows/prettyokpod" target="_blank">our RSS feed</a> there and that should get the job done.</p>
  <p>Okay, this has been way too many words already. I'm feeling a little sentimental at the holidays, so I mean it sincerely when I say thank you for spending any time with us at all, much less the amount of time you sickos have spent listening to us ramble.</p>
